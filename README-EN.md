# GiveHope
GiveHope is a web-based application built with React.js, Node.js, and Express.js for managing donations.

GiveHope is a donation management system that serves as a platform for managing donations between donors, beneficiaries, and administrators. The system provides an easy-to-use interface that allows donors to make donations and track their donation history. Beneficiaries can use the system to create and manage their profiles, as well as to request and receive donations. Administrators can manage donation requests, approve and reject beneficiaries, and ensure that donations are distributed efficiently. The goal of the donation management system is to simplify the process of donating to those in need, while providing a secure and transparent platform for managing donations. By facilitating communication and coordination between donors, beneficiaries, and administrators, the system aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the donation process, ultimately helping to make a positive impact on people's lives.
